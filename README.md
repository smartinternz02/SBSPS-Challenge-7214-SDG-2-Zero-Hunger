# SBSPS-Challenge-7214-SDG-2-Zero-Hunger

<h3>Agriculture has been the backbone of Telangana's economy for a long time. There are multiple ways to increase and improve the crop yield and the quality of the crops. In this case study, we have directed to predict the price of the crop, for which we used real time data of crops Groundnut, Maize, and Bengal Gram. We have analyzed the type of crop, current price, and its location of harvest in Telangana. By analyzing these features we could predict the price of the crop.</h3>

**Steps Performed:**

- Imported both input CSV files using Pandas read_csv function
- Checked Null values using isnull function
- Checked unique values from Categorical columns using value_counts() function
- Visualized data using different graphs (Pie, Histogram, Scatter Plot) using **Matplotlib , Seaborn library and Tableau.
- Used LabelEncoder to convert Categorical columns to Numerical columns
- Selected Features & Targeted Column & assigned to a Variable
- Created Training & Testing Data using train_test_split
- Used XGBoost Regression Machine Learning model. 
- Used K-Fold for Validation
```
   Maximum Accuracy is around 99.99603365232768 % using XGBoost Model

Conclusion: In this study, certain Data Analytics techniques and Machine Learning model were adopted to estimate crop price analysis with real-time data. Linear Regression is employed for discovering important information from the agricultural datasets. Using this real-time data and Machine Learning model we could predict the price of the crop at different regions of Telangana for different volumes. XG Boost Model is giving the highest accuracy of 99.9960 %, hence we will use XGBoost Model for prediction and is reliable.
